In order to add glad to a project just follow the nexts steps:

    1. Add the include folder in the include directory of the project (in whatever IDE you're using).
   
    2. Add the file glad.c to the source files of your projects.
   
    3. Include glad.c as the first include of your files.

That should be enought to get all the functions of OpenGL in C++.

    Glad is a file that contains all the declarations and functions of the API for OpenGL in C++, that's the reason because it should be the first include in the files and also the reason why it's so important.
